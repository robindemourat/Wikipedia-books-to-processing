# Wikipedia-books-to-processing
Some material made for the occasion of the workshop "Les matières numériques du livre" held at University Rennes 2 in 2014-2015. The folder basically contain some artoo.js scripts to scrape Wikibooks pages, and then starter files in processing in order to display and interact books through processing sketches.
